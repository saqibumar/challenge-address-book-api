Challenge - Address book with GraphQL API

# RUN
- git clone git@github.com:saqibumar/challenge-address-book-api.git
- cd challenge-address-book-api
- npm i
- npm start

# Solution Architecture

- Gathered the required packages necessary to work around graphQL
- Set up the node environment with typescript (latest versions)
- Creating data models and associated resolver

# Learning Curve

- The new graphql-upload library doesn't have compatibility to import so I had to go with multer
- I am not so familiar with graphql so it took me a bit to get a grab of resolvers and helped me learn the implementation

# Challenges

- Mainly graphQL was a challenge over all
- Main challenge was to explore the node packages that I was not familiar with like graphql and subsets
- On react frontent I had to explore apollo client library for graphQL
