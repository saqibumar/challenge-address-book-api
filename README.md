Challenge - Address book with GraphQL API

# RUN
git clone 

# Solution Architecture

- Gathered the required packages necessary to work around graphQL
- Set up the node environment with typescript (latest versions)

# Learning Curve

- The new graphql-upload library doesn't have compatibility to import so I had to go with multer
- I am not so familiar with graphql so it took me a bit to get a grab of resolvers

# Challenges

- Mainly graphQL was a challenge over all
- Main challenge was to explore the node packages that I was not familiar with like graphql and subsets
- On react frontent I had to explore apollo client library for graphQL
